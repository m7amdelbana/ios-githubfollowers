# Overview:

This project is a simple project using Swift programming language, I build it without VIPER architecture. I really like VIPER, but I focus at this project on using 100% programmatic UI, also I like Interface Builder and I work on it at my projects, so at this project I used code to make the UI to help who is use code to write code less by provide some useful extensions.



# App Premise:

- The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
- The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
- The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower. 
- The user is able to save favorite username searches so they don’t have to type them every time. This needs to persist between app launches.



# Requirements:

- 100% programmatic UI - No Storyboard
- No 3rd Party Libraries



# Details:

- Use the GitHub API - No authentication needed 
    - Followers endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/followers/
    - User info endpoint - https://developer.github.com/v3/users/
- When showing more information about a user, what information you display is up to you. If you were creating this product, what information do you think users want to see?



# Design:

- 100% responsive ui design.
- Dark and Light mode.
